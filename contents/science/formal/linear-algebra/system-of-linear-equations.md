- Consistent and inconsistent equations
- dimension
- line plane intersection
- plane plane intersection
- matrix notation

***

- linear algebra => after several semester of calculus in undergraduate math curriculum
- constant function < linear equation < quadradic function => simple < intermediate < complex
- system of linear equations = more than one linear equation
- linear equation => a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn = b
- linear equation => no exponentiation, no roots, no trigonometric function, variable product, variable quotient, etc.
