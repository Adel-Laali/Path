- Can you vaccum clean under the sofa?
- No, the head of the cleaner does not go there.

- Can you warm up the food?
- Sure, but it will take 15 minutes.
- Why?
- I can't ask fire to heat up the food faster. If I increase the fire, the food burns.
- But I built a box to use micro-waves instead of fire. I warm up the food in 2 minutes.
