### Notes

- electromagnetic force is the reason:
    - atoms form (protons and electrons)
    - chemical bonds form
    - molecules form
    - intermollecular geometry forms
    - enzyme-substrate complex forms
    - DNA base-pair forms
- fundamental forces/interactions
    - gravity => weakest, long distances
    - electromagnetism => much stronger than gravity, small distances
    - strong force => strongest, very small distances
    - weak force => weak, very small distances
- radioactive radiation found to be of 3 different types, because of 3 different reactions when exposed to magnetic fields
- name of alpha, beta, and gamma particles comes because we did not know about subatomic particles
- radiations
    - alpha particle = emitted helium nucleous
    - beta particle = accelerated electron (or positron)
    - gamma particle = high energy photon (from nuclear reaction, not electron transition)
- neclear processes reasons (always instability):
    - large nucleous (strong force can't hold them) (alpha)
        - alpha emission
        - spontaneous fission
    - large neutron/proton ratio (more neutrons than allowed) (beta)
        - beta emission
    - low neutron/proton ratio (more protons than allowed) (beta)
        - positron emission
        - electron capture
    - excited state (gamma)
        - gamma emission
- most stable isotoped have even number of protons and neutrons
- nutron = proton + electron => mass + charge
- radioactive emission is bad for DNA => because it has high energy and might replace genetic code => cancer
- nuclear reaction => energy <-> matter
    - ![Einsteins famous formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?E=mc^2)
        - matter is densest form of energy (or)
        - matter can be converted to energy
