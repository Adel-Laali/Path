# Concentration mass percent

### Concepts

- mass percent
- solution
- solute
- solvent
- concentration
- dilute solution
- concentrated solution
- molarity
- mole
- bleach
- sodium

### Notes

- concentration = solute / solvent
- molarity = moles solute / liter solution
- mass percentage = (mass component / mass solution) * 100
