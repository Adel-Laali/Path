### Notes

- systems tend to => the configuration with the lowest possible energy
- covalent bond = some orbital overlap
    - electron pair of the bond inhabit that region
    - because of mutual attraction of electrons and nuclei
- shorter bond = stronger bond
    - shorter = more orbital overlap
- direct overlap = stronger bond (compared to angled overlap)
