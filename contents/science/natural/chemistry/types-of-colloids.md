- Tyndall effect
- colloidal particle
- protein
- solute
- dispersed phase
- dispersion medium
- colloidal dimensions
- paint pigment
- atmosphere
- condense
- droplet
- precipitation
- starch
- emulsion
- immisible
- coalescence (chemistry)
- emulsifying agent
- casein
- electrical charge
- charged electrode
- electrode
- coagulation
- precipitate
- electrostatic precipitator

### Notes

- Based on mixture degree
    - homogenous => mixing
    - colloid => mixing and not mixing, but not visible to the naked eye
    - suspension => mixing and not mixing, visible to the naked eye
    - heterogenous => not mixing
- Colloid particles are large enough to scatter light
- Colloid samples
    - milk
    - fog
    - smoke
- Disperse phases and disperse mediums
    - smoke = solid dispersed in gas
    - cloud/fog/mist = liquid disperesed in gas
    - milk/mayonnaise/butter = liquid disperesed in liquid
    - jelly/gel = liquid disperesed in solid
    - foam/whipped cream = gas disperesed in solid
