### Notes

- to balance
    - acidic and basic condition
        - split into oxidation half-reaction and reduction half-reaction
        - balance anything other than hydrogen and oxygen
        - then balance oxygen by adding water molecules
        - balance hydrogen atoms by adding hydrogen ions
        - then balance the electrical charges by adding electrons
        - then multiply half-reactions to get to equal electrons
        - then combine half-reactions
        - remove similar species from both sides
    - basic conditions
        - then add equivalent number of hydroxides to both sides to cancel protons (hydrogne ion)
        - combine protons and hydroxides to form water molecules
        - cancel any like-terms that remain
