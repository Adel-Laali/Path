# Predicting precipitation

### Concepts

- solubility product
- solution
- precipitate
- chemical reaction
- calcium
- carbonate
- calcium carbonate
- aquous solution
- equilibrium
- dissosiated form
- reaction quotiont
- nitrate
- calcium nitrate
- sodium
- sodium carbonate
- dissolve
- ion
- magnesium
- hydroxide
- magnesium hydroxide
- calcium hydroxide
- ion concentration
- squared
- oxalate
- calcium oxalate
- pH
- acicity
- basicity
- manganese
- negative log
- pOH

### Notes

- percipitation occurs when Q >= Ksp
- negative power => X to the negative Y
- use case => detergents and washing machines (to balance such that no stain/percipitation remains in clothes)
