### Notes

- VSEPR theory is developed to explain experimentally observed molecular geometry
- hybridized orbitals become of equal energy (degenerate)
- lone pair repulsion > bonding pair
- as atoms get bigger, the farther away lone pairs would be from each other, and the less hybridization they make
- VSEPR theory gets worse as central atoms get bigger
- p orbitals extend of three axes (x & y & z) => 90 degree
