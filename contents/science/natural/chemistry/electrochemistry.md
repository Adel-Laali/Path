### Notes

- Oxidation in anode, reduction in cathode
- voltaic/galvanic cell => spontaneous redox reaction generates current
- electrolytic cell => electric current causes non-spontaneous redox reaction
- voltaic cell notation
    - oxodation half-cell (anode) || reduction half-cell (cathode)
    - ![Voltaic cell notation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Zn(s)|Zn^{2+}(aq)||Cu^{2+}(aq)|Cu(s))
- electron flows from high electric potential to low electric potential, just as water flows from hgih gravitational potential to low gravitational potential
- cell potential unit = volts
