# Temperature conversion

### Concepts

- Temperature
- mass
- length
- time
- unit
- temperature scale
- farenheit
- celsius
- kelvin
- SI unit
- conversion
- equation
- degree
- freezing point of pure water
- boiling point of pure water
- brine
- freezing point of brine
- boiling point of brine
- magnitude
- absolute temperature scale
- lowest possible temperature
- heat energy
- absolute zero
-

### Notes

- Only US uses Farenheit
- Scientific community uses Kelvin => because Kelvin is SI unit for temperature
- celsius degree = kelvin degree != farenheit degree
- temperature = measure of heat energy 
- we can't have negative temperature => because it ruins some of our math formulas (why and how?)
    - isn't negative mass what Dirak came to?
